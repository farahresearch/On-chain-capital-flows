# On-Chain SQL Research

This repository contains SQL-based analyses of on-chain data,
focused on understanding capital flows, exchange activity,
and large-wallet behavior across Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.

## Research Focus
- Exchange inflows and outflows
- Stablecoin movement and liquidity routing
- Whale accumulation and distribution patterns
- Wallet activity and inactivity analysis

## Methodology
- Raw blockchain data queried using SQL
- ERC-20 transfer and transaction-level analysis
- Emphasis on interpretation, not just metrics

## Why This Matters
On-chain data reveals capital intent before price action.
These queries are designed to surface behavioral patterns
that often precede major market moves.

## Tools
- SQL (on-chain datasets)
- Ethereum & EVM-compatible chains
