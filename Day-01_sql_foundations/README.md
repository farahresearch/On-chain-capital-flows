## Foundational Whale Wallet Analysis
This module focuses on identifying high-impact wallets based on value-weighted transaction behavior, with the goal of isolating actors that meaningfully influence on-chain liquidity and capital distribution.


### Analytical Objectives
- Identify wallets responsible for the largest share of on-chain value transfer
- Detect consistently active wallets with sustained capital movement
- Assess whether liquidity flow is concentrated among a small set of dominant actors

### Methodology
- Aggregate transaction volume and frequency at the wallet level
- Rank wallets by total value transferred to emphasize economic relevance
- Filter low-signal activity to isolate wallets with material market impact

### Analyst Insight
-High activity alone does not imply conviction.
-Value-weighted behavior provides stronger signals
-than raw transaction frequency.
