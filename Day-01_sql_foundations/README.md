## Whale Activity Analysis

This module focuses on identifying high-impact wallets
based on transaction frequency and value transferred.

The objective is to surface wallets whose behavior
may influence market liquidity or signal accumulation
and distribution phases.

### Research Questions
- Which wallets move the highest total value on-chain?
- Which wallets are consistently active over time?
- Are there dominant actors controlling liquidity flow?

### Methodology
- Aggregate transaction counts per wallet
- Rank wallets by total value transferred
- Filter noise to focus on economically relevant actors

### Analyst Insight
High activity alone does not imply conviction.
Value-weighted behavior provides stronger signals
than raw transaction frequency.
