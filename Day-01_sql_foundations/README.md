## Whale-activity


### Goal
Practice core SQL commands used in blockchain analytics to identify
and rank whale wallets.

### SQL Concepts Practiced
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- COUNT()
- SUM()
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT

### Analyst Questions Answered
- Which wallets are most active?
- Which wallets move the most value?
- How do we rank whale wallets by influence?

### Notes
These queries use simulated transaction data to focus on analytical
thinking before moving to real on-chain datasets (Dune).

Bismillah — consistency over perfection.
