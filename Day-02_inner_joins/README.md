# Day 02 — SQL INNER JOIN (Real-World Use Cases)

Today’s focus was mastering SQL INNER JOIN through real-world,
analytics-driven examples with an emphasis on on-chain data.

## What I Practiced
- INNER JOIN fundamentals
- Filtering for real activity
- Whale detection logic
- Protocol usage analysis
- Entity-based transaction tracking
- DISTINCT + aggregation with JOINs

## Why INNER JOIN Matters
INNER JOIN is used to:
- Remove inactive or irrelevant records
- Focus only on meaningful behavior
- Analyze actual on-chain activity
- Build reliable metrics

## Files
- `inner_join_real_world.sql` — practical INNER JOIN examples inspired by
  on-chain analytics, DeFi research, and behavioral analysis.

Bismillah. Consistency over intensity.
